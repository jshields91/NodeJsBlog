	            	<h2>1) What is it?</h2>
		            <p>As an open source, cross-platform runtime environment, Node.js facilitates server-side 
		            processing and network applications. From the ‘.js’ at the end, we can conclude that Node 
		            applications written in JavaScript. Node.js utilizes Google’s V8 JavaScript engine to facilitate 
		            real-time communications between client and server. Node.js excels when utilized for applications 
		            that are fast and IO scalable since it uses a single processing thread to facilitate its workload 
		            (compared to other server-side languages that typically utilize multiple threads, demoting IO 
		            scalability). On the other hand, utilizing a single thread for all client requests becomes 
		            problematic when heavy computation is involved; these situations have the potential to overload 
		            Node’s single thread, causing all future client requests to be blocked until resources became 
		            available.</p>

	            	<h2>2) A Non-Blocking IO</h2>
		            <p>Another feature that makes Node.js standout from traditional server-side languages is the 
		            concept of a non-blocking IO. This is facilitated through the utilization of callbacks, allowing 
		            the server to asynchronously respond to a request by activating a callback function when the 
		            original request has been fulfilled. This allows Node.js to support a vast amount of concurrent 
		            connections across multiple platforms.</p>

	            	<h2>3) NPM</h2>
		            <p>Furthermore, Node.js comes with a built-in package manager (NPM) that includes version and 
		            dependency management; this allows publically available modules to be utilized within Node.js 
		            applications to support a variety of features and functionality. These modules are available 
		            through Node.js’s CLI tool or via <a href="https://npmjs.org/">https://npmjs.org/</a>.</p>
